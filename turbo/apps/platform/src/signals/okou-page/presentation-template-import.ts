 * compile until someone says what file produces one. Without that, a new kind
 * would be publishable by the CLI and unreachable from the product.
 *
 * `.ppt` is here because a deck old enough to still be saved in the legacy
 * binary format is exactly the deck whose visual language is worth reusing,
 * and a picker that greys it out reads as "not supported" rather than "export
 * it first". `.pdf` sits under presentation because that is the only kind it
 * has ever compiled to here; the mapping is this product's choice, not a fact
